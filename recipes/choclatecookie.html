    <h1> Evil Choclate Chip Cookies</h1>
    <img src="../images/cookies.jpg" alt="Picture of Cookies">
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> This is my great Aunt Phoebe's amazing choclate chip recipe. My Aunt phoebe used to bake these cookies in the basement
        of family owned morgue. Shortly after baking her cookies, aunt phoebe would cast a spell over the cookies to give the 
        cookies a special taste and effect on those who would consume it
    </p> 
    <p>Each baking pan would create 12 cookies. After baking 10 pans' worth of cookies, Aunt Phoebe would take the cookies and store 
        them inside of coffins to cool. My great Evil bitch aunt phoebe would then wrap all the cookies and distribute them to the local 
        elementary schools. The children were all obsessed with her cookies frequently describing them as the best choclate chip cookies 
        they have ever had. 
    </p>
    <p> Around 12 days after eating all the children who ate the cookies would drop dead. It wasn't until 5 years later and 578 dead children 
        that the FBI finally connected the dots. The FBI arrested aunt phoebe and took her to jail. Aunt Phoebes trial lasted less than an hour.
        The jury deliberated for 42 minutes for finding her guilty of <strong>over 500 counts of first degree murder</strong>.
        She was convicted and sentenced to death by the electric chair.
